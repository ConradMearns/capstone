      Building a spilling 
    wall on Decker Creek (a tributary of the Fraser River system) west of Burns 
    Lake, British Columbia  Soil Bioengineering 
    and Biotechnical Slope Stabilization    The term "Bioengineering" 
    causes some confusion, as in recent years it has been appropriated by the 
    biomedical industry. Today for most people it brings to mind genetically modified 
    organisms or mechanical artificial hearts. Early in the 20th century it referred 
    to a group of activities like that pictured above, where living and nonliving 
    materials are used to achieve an engineering goal. In this instance: the construction 
    of a spilling wall to stabilize a creek bank by preventing cutbank erosion.  It is a very broad term 
    encompassing many different techniques. Many of these were refined over thousands 
    of years prior to being actively grouped together under the umbrella of "Bioengineering". 
    Others have been developed more recently as practitioners experiment with 
    new ways to address environmental challenges. Depending upon how it is defined, 
    Bioengineering could include everything from erosion 
    prevention structures like that above; to a living green 
    roof on a building; or a reed 
    bed wetland treating waste water; or plants grown to bioaccumulate heavy 
    metals in order to decontaminate a site ( phytoremediation ).  For the purposes of riparian 
    restoration, techniques like the spilling wall in the photo (refered to as Soil Bioengineering) are likely to be the most 
    useful, and so will be the focus here. This section is intended more to provide 
    an introduction to Soil Bioengineering and promote understanding, rather than 
    a complete "how to" guide, however many of the methods that will 
    be discussed are simple enough that they could be tried using the descriptions 
    provided.   top of page
