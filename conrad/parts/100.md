Dev wants us to firstly - fix the GIS data in Farming Simulator, and also work on algorithms for controlling tractor movements based on optimizations for time, and soil erosion. I'm not as interested in the more general pathfinding algorithms - I'm more interested in what the soil erosion algorithms look like.

In general, the question is how can we create an self driving (or assisted) tractor that not only covers the area that it needs to cover, but also prevents soil erosion? This comes with the context that the if the tractor drives on the same path many times over and over again, the soil will erode. What does this really mean though? Could we simply plot a naive course in which a tractor just varies it's course by plus or minus the width of it's tires?

What do human farmers look for when driving to avoid tractor-based erosion?

Are there tools that could help us model soil erosion already?
