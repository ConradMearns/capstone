# Wednesday, April 1, 2020 - Building compound models for surface processes
https://www.agu.org/Events/SCIWS8-Exploring-Surface-Processes-how-to-build-coupled-models

Looks like this article could be valuable - the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System is an NSF funded initiative for software analysis on surface processes. Over 200 models, tools, and cyberinf.

It appears the tooling is primarly built in Python, and includes multiple tutorials and jupyter notebooks to get users started. It costs $150 ($75 for students)

Ah, actually it's a workshop, not strictly an article.
