# Thursday, March 26, 2020 - Soil Erosion Simulation / Study Tool
Sounds like it effectively meets (most) of the requirements of our client - granted it's not a VR simualtion, but it covers education of the USLE equation and how to effectively make decisions using such a model.

## Abstract
The need for education and understanding about the continuing soil erosion problem is acute. Most segments of the population have little knowledge of the critical impacts erosion can have on the environment. The use of the Soil Conservation Service model for erosion determination, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), is a good perceptual tool to show the impacts of human and natural action on the land. Micro-DYNAMO, a special-purpose computer simulation language, was programmed to simulate the USLE under several different environmental and farming practice scenarios. This type of simulation will never duplicate nature but will allow natural processes to be evaluated and this information to be used for rational decision making and understanding.
