Do the simulations in previously found models account for varying layers of soil compatcion? How do they model soil? Does it even matter?

> (1) surface tillage (moldboard plowing in most experiments) did not completely alleviate surface compaction and (2) deep penetration of frost did not alleviate lower subsoil compaction (most experiments were located in northern latitudes where soil is commonly frozen to 40-50 inches in winter).

This described a lot of very interesting ways to avoid compaction in depth - by creating a 'hardpan' layer of soil, compaction in lower subsoil layers can be reducued - as well as simply making the tire load lighter.

Do previous simulations account for tractor / tire load? I would hope so, it's an important factor in slipage...

There is also an analysis on the plasticity of soil at the end of this paper which links the soil water content and soil denstity to compressibility.


## Intro

Twenty-first-century farm economics stimulate farmers to increase the size of their operations. To improve labor efficiency, farm equipment usually increases in size. Tractors, combines, forage harvesters, grain and forage wagons, manure spreaders, and lime trucks are all bigger than they used to be. Twenty years ago, for example, 2.5-ton box-type manure spreaders were common in Pennsylvania, whereas today liquid manure spreaders may weigh 20 or 30 tons. The increasing size of farm equipment may cause significant soil compaction that can negatively affect soil productivity as well as environmental quality.
